## Abstract

This is a project focused on deadwood recognition using Artificial Intelligent (AI) method. BB-KI-CHIPS project aims at building AI chips and detecting debris by UAV data.  In this project, Random Forest (RF) [1], Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Residual Neural Network (Resnet), Mobile Neural Network (Mobilenet),  Visual Geometry Group Neural Network (VGG16) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) machine learning methods have been used. And the accuracy was increased to 97% by fine tuning work.

## Results

Random Forest (RF), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Residual Neural Network (Resnet), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Mobile Neural Network (Mobilenet) and Visual Geometry Group Neural Network (VGG16) machine learning methods have been used in this project. 
Overfitting problem can be solved by early stopping callback.
And the accuracy was increased to 97.2% by fine tuning work.
Decision fusion achieved better performance 97.7% and can be robust to outliers.
The training model works well without mixed patches.
